  <abstract>Coastal features within and adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area (such as islands, rocks and the Queensland mainland). Major coral cay features,major and other coral reef structures (as defined by the reef shoal edge) and tidal, drying or emergent reef areas within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.

The coastline of Queensland was produced under specific contract for GBRMPA by AUSLIG in 1984. Originally engineered by AUSLIG from datasets produced by the Division of National Mapping and RAN Hydrographic Service; Queensland coastal information produced by AUSLIG at 250k scale with 100k elements from developing technology at the time of genesis; Island information is specific to the Great Barrier Reef Region as produced from RAN Hydrographic Service data at 100k scale; mangrove information at 250k scale as produced by AUSLIG.</abstract>
